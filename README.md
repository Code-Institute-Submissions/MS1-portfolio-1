------------------------------------
## Jing Xu Personal Portfolio Website
This project aims to:
* review and deepen the knowledge and skills I learned in **HTML/CSS Fundamentals** and **User Centric Frontend Development**
* explored a practice to  demonstrate my knowledge and skills for future employers/co-workers
* involve simplism and aesthetics for users' comfort as much as I can


------------------------------------
## User Experience (UX)
------------------------------------

Researched some of the best practice of personal portfolio websites of 2019, I realised that minimal design and bold visual impact are still the mainstream. These two characteristics shall encourage and welcome the users to explore the information I would like to demonstrate.

### User stories

* As a user, I expect the the information to be well organised and easily navigated, so that I don't have to waste time getting confused; 
* As a user, I want to know the skillset of this developer, so that I can decide whether she is capable for my role/project;
* As a user, I want to know the experience of this developer, so that I can see her passion and interest as well as her potential;







------------------------------------
I modified the website to use parallax scrolling which embraces the users with a lively touch.
